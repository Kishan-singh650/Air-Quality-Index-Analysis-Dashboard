## 📊 Project Overview
This project showcases an **Air Quality Index (AQI) Analysis Dashboard** designed to monitor and analyze air pollution levels over time. The dashboard provides valuable insights into **average AQI, current AQI, unhealthy days, pollutant concentrations, and AQI categories** across different years.  

The interactive filters for **Year** and **AQI Category** allow users to explore data dynamically, helping to better understand pollution trends and their impact on health and environment.

## 🔑 Key Insights
- **Average AQI:** 202.2  
- **Current AQI:** 195.5  
- **No. of Unhealthy Days:** 16  

### 📌 Detailed Analysis
- **Average AQI Variation:** AQI varies consistently across years with ~23–27% distribution.  
- **Daily PM10 Levels:** Highest pollution observed on **Sunday & Monday ($52k each)**, lowest mid-week.  
- **AQI Categories:**  
  - Hazardous: **61.46%**  
  - Unhealthy: **35.04%**  
  - Good: **3.49%**  
- **Pollutant Trends by Month:** PM10 & NO₂ dominate pollution levels, while SO₂, CO, and Ozone have smaller but notable contributions.  
- **Seasonal Trends:** Higher pollutant concentrations in winter months (Nov–Dec).
